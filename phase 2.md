# Project Phase 2
## Data Collection
Data is collected from 9/26/2025 to 11/5/2025. Data is kept under two main tables. One for the training data and one for the tournament error data. Training data includes training_date, training_type, attendance, throwing_hours and the tournament error table contains match_date, opponent_level, minutes_played, errors_total, errors_drop, errors_throw and errors_miscom. 

## Hypothesis
For the second phase of the project, 2 H₀ are determined:

*H₀*: Throwing hours do not affect tournament error rate.

*H₁*: Increasing throwing hours decreases the tournament error rate.


*H₀*: Minutes played and opponent level do not affect tournament error rate.

*H₁*: As minutes played and opponent level increase, the tournament error rate increases as well.

## Visualization
For further analysis of the distribution of error types, minutes played/ error rate, weekly throwing hour/ error rate ad opponent level/ error rate graphics are created.

## Discussion 
From the graphics, one can say that:
- My errors are mainly throwing mistakes.
- As minutes played increase, errors also increase
- as weekly throwing hours increase, errors decrease
- opponent level affects the error rate, but it's not strong

First findings show that minutes played and throwing hour has signficant effect on my performance. For the effect of opponent level I need to collect more data.
