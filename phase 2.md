# Project Phase 2
## Data Collection
Data is collected from 9/26/2025 to 11/5/2025. Data is kept under two main tables. One for the training data and one for the tournament error data. Training data includes training_date, training_type, attendance, throwing_hours and the tournament error table contains match_date, opponent_level, minutes_played, errors_total, errors_drop, errors_throw and errors_miscom. 

## Hypothesis
For the second phase of the project 2 H₀ are determined:
*H₀*: Throwing hours do not have an effect on tournament error rate.
*H₁*: Increasing throwing hours decrease tournament error rate.

*H₀*: Minutes played and opponent level do not have an effect on tournament error rate.
*H₁*: As minutes played and opponent level increase tournament error rate increase as well.

## Visualization
For further analysis distribution of error types, minutes played/ error rate, weekly throwing hour/ error rate ad opponent level/ error rate graphics are created.




## Discussion 
From the graphics one can say that:
- my errors are mainly throwing mistakes.
- As minutes played increase error is also increase
- as weekly throwing hours increase error decrease
- opponent level effects error rate but it's not strong

First findings show that minutes played and throwing hour has signficant effect on my performance. For the effect of opponent level I need to collect more data.
