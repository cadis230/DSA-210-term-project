# DSA-210-term-project

## Project Overview
Throughout the year I attend several trainings and tournaments of ultimate frisbee. I usually have 3 times 3 hours (total of 9 hours) training in a week. In this project, I will investigate if I can integrate my trainings into my play in tournaments. What I mean is, I will analyze my errors in the tournaments and compare what I have trained until the tournament. The aim of the project is to understand my weak sides and improve my play by the help of the trainings until the end of the year. 

## Objectives
### The Training Content
Analyzing what I have been trained for every week before the tournament. 

### Identifying the Major Errors
Analyzing every point I have played in tournaments and categorizing my errors. After categorizing, calculating the percentages of my errors.

### Updating My Training Plan
